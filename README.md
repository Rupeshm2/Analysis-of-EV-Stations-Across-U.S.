# EV Charging Stations Analysis and Dashboard

## Overview
This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) charging station data across the United States to identify trends, access types, and gaps in sustainability. Using advanced data analytics, visualization tools, and machine learning, we built a comprehensive Power BI dashboard to provide actionable insights for decision-makers.

## Business Problem
1. Drive growth by targeting underserved regions based on data-driven trends.
2. Identify gaps in sustainability efforts and promote eco-friendly energy solutions.
3. Determine if the number of fast charging stations is adequate for the growing demand.
4. Assess the dominance of ownership categories among charging stations.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [U.S. Department of Energy â€“ Alternative Fuels Data Center](https://afdc.energy.gov)
- **Number of Records:** 78,837  
- The dataset includes information about station types, access types, location, energy sources, and more.

## Project Plan
1. Data Collection and Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Feature Engineering
3. Dashboard Design and Visualization
4. Advanced Analytics
5. Aesthetic Refinements and User Experience Enhancements

## Key Analyses Performed
- **Trend Analysis**: Growth of EV charging stations over time.
- **Access Type Distribution**: Public vs. private station accessibility.
- **Top States by Utilization**: Identification of high-demand areas.
- **Availability of Fast Chargers**: Analysis of DC fast chargers across regions.
- **Stakeholder Classification**: Categorization of ownership entities.
- **Forecasting**: Machine learning predictions for future expansion.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Processing**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Visualization**: Power BI
- **Machine Learning**: MAQ Chart for predictive analytics
- **Web Scraping**: Collected data using BeautifulSoup (where necessary)
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Power BI maps

## Dashboard Features
1. **Interactive Visuals**: Area charts, bar charts, donut charts, and tree maps for clear insights.
2. **Geospatial Maps**: Display of charging stations across the U.S.
3. **Advanced Features**:
   - **Q&A Feature**: Ask natural language queries within the dashboard.
   - **Key Influencers**: Identification of critical factors impacting EV station growth.
   - **Decomposition Tree**: In-depth exploration of key trends and patterns.

## Results and Insights
- California leads in EV charging stations, showcasing its commitment to EV infrastructure.
- 95% of stations are publicly accessible, ensuring wide user access.
- Significant growth in EV stations since 2010, with a surge post-2019.
- Private entities own 85% of stations, emphasizing their role in expansion.
- Only 18% of stations offer DC Fast Charging, with less than 1% using renewable energy, highlighting areas for improvement.
